/***********
 * NOTE:    I tried to finish as much as possible, but due to my VirtualBox being wiped clean twice
 *          (once on the 26th, another time on the 30th) and losing my data and the amount of work I
 *          have to complete and midterms for all my other classes as well, I wasn't able to prioritize completing
 *          this as much as I would have preferred. In the future, I'll do my best to ensure
 *          I have a failsafe for these situations. I should also note that the program does not compile currently.
 *          Will continue to work on it until the final late deadline.
 *
 * Using a linked list for the data structure involved with storing the commands and descriptions
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 * Advantage:        A linked list has a dynamic size. A linked list can grow or shrink as needed, as nodes can be added
 *                   or removed as necessary. In the case of its application for this PA, it is great as we don't know
 *                   ahead of time exactly how many commands (and their respective descriptions) will be stored for the
 *                   game. Using a linked list eliminates that worry.
 *
 * Disadvantage:    Linked lists have a slower access time compared to arrays. This is because they need to traverse the
 *                  list in order to find a specific element, whereas elements in an array can be accessed through
 *                  indexing. This means it would take more time to find a specific command (and its respective description)
 *                  when attempting to delete or edit it.
