Hi, I've included this textfile to highlight the issues I faced while completing PA1. 
I was previously in contact with Duy and Professor Sakire about how my virtual machine had wiped itself completely
clean on two ocassions (Once on the 26th and another the day before submission). On the 26th and 31st, I was unable
to recover my lost files and had to redo the entirety of the PA from scratch. With midterms and other work I had for
my other classes, I was unable to put as much time into the PA as I would have liked and ended up rushing through it.
Currently, the PA does not compile, possibly due to linker issues. I'd like to apologize for the quality of work I 
ended up producing for the first PA and assure you that this is not the quality of work you will see from me moving
forward. Additionally, I've taken the proper measures in ensuring that I have a backup method in the event my VM
wipes itself again.
